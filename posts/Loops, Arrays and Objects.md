Java Array is a collection of elements stored in a sequence. You can iterate over the elements of an array in Java using any of the looping statements.

In the this example we have an array of myFavFoods and a loop to display all the items in the array, also we can select individual items using various methods in this case we used modulo to select all the odd and then the even items index number. We can also change the item using the index number and add to the array using .push
