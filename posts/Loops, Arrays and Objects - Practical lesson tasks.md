## Task 1 - Shopping Cart

We are going to be using an array of objects provided as a simple shopping cart example.
We need to work out the total cost of the items in the shopping cart.

Part 1

3. Loop through each item in the array and add the value of the item to the total price, remember to account for the quantity.
4. Return the totalPrice Variable
5. Console.log the returned value
