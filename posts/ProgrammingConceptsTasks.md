At the end of this lesson the take home task was to calculate a tip amount from a bill, I started with 2 functions one to calculate the tip as 2% of the bill and the other to add the bill and the tip to give the total bill. I then declared the variables like the pre tip bill, the tip percentage, first and last name, full name and a variable totalTip to call the tipTotal function. Then the last thing to do was to write out the results using document.write of full name total bill and tip amount.
